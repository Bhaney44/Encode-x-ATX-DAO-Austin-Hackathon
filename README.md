This is a Repository for the Encode x ATX DAO Austin Hackathon. Our project is a compliance software for digital assets on Algorand. The project focus is securities compliance for DeFi.

# Compliance for DeFi Digital Assets on Algorand

The problem is there is a lack of clarity in determining which digital assets are securities and which digital assets are not securities. Still, creating a culture of compliance is critical on Algorand to ensure value is created and captured in as cost-efficient manner as possible. Effective compliance is also a sterling method for ensuring a professional culture and stimulating the production of intellectual property and work product. Creating compliance protocols helps projects to reduce regulatory risk, promote professionalism, and stimulate cost-efficient business practices. In turn, these same benefits carry over to the layer-1 protocols on which projects are built, such as Algorand. 

Our project, the Choice Coin Compliance AI is an embedded system which formalizes human knowledge using natural language processing to statistically measure the probability that a particular asset is a security. The technology statistically measures digital assets on a scale of 0 to 1, where an asset with a score of 0 is almost certain to be considered a security and an asset with a score of 1 is almost certainly not a security. The goal for this software is to help asset creators on Algorand that do not wish create security tokens, engineer their assets to reduce regulatory risk and comply with the law.
